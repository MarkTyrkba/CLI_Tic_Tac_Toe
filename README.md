# Tic-Tac-Toe

Hello! This is my implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in the Rust programming language. This game supports two players who take turns making moves, working based on the simple rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Running the Game

1. Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, [install it](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
4. Controls: 
  Use arrow keys to move the cursor across the game board.
  Press Enter to make a move in the current cell.
  Press Esc to exit the game.
